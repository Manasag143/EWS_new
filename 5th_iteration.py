### Balance Sheet Issues Risk Classification

â€¢ The company's debt has increased by INR700 crores, and the interest cost has gone up due to the RBI's interest rate hike, with the average interest rate increasing from 4.5% to 7.7%.
  - High: yes (The debt increase is approximately 22% ((700/3194)*100) compared to the previous reported debt, which falls into the Medium category. However, considering the significant increase in interest rates and its impact on the company's profitability, it can be argued that the risk level is High due to the potential long-term effects on the company's financial health.)
  - Medium: no 
  - Low: no 
  - Not_Applicable: no

â€¢ The company's standalone business has seen a decline in networth from INR100 crores to INR4 crores, which is attributed to the project mix and completion of legacy projects.
  - High: yes (The decline in networth is significant, with a reduction of 96% (96/100), indicating a substantial erosion of the company's equity base, which poses a High risk to the company's financial stability.)
  - Medium: no 
  - Low: no 
  - Not_Applicable: no

â€¢ The company has a significant amount of receivables, including INR400 crores from Afghanistan, which is expected to be received in the next few quarters.
  - High: no 
  - Medium: no 
  - Low: no 
  - Not_Applicable: yes (The criteria provided do not directly address the risk associated with significant receivables. However, it can be inferred that the company's working capital and liquidity might be impacted, but without specific thresholds for receivables, it's challenging to classify this as High, Medium, or Low risk based solely on the given criteria.)

Note: The classification of risk levels for the balance sheet issues is based on the provided criteria and the previous year's financial data. The analysis considers both quantitative thresholds and qualitative assessments of the described issues.

### P&L (Income Statement) Issues Risk Classification

â€¢ The company is facing margin pressure due to a mix of projects and execution of legacy projects, which has impacted the PAT, with the standalone margin being lower due to the mix of projects.
  - High: no (The previous reported operating margin was 5.50%, but the current quarter's operating margin is not provided. However, the company's profitability has been impacted, but the exact decline in margin is not quantifiable based on the given data.)
  - Medium: yes (The decline in PAT due to project mix and execution of legacy projects indicates a potential medium risk, as it suggests some impact on profitability, although the exact percentage decline is not specified.)
  - Low: no (The impact on PAT and standalone margin suggests more than a low risk.)
  - Not_Applicable: no

â€¢ The company's profitability has been impacted due to various factors, including project mix, execution of legacy projects, and high interest costs, resulting in a lower PAT.
  - High: no (The previous reported profitability was 943 Cr, but the current quarter's profitability is not provided. Without the current quarter's data, it's challenging to determine the exact decline.)
  - Medium: yes (The impact of various factors on profitability, including project mix, execution of legacy projects, and high interest costs, suggests a medium risk, as it indicates some decline in profitability.)
  - Low: no (The mention of "lower PAT" suggests more than a low risk.)
  - Not_Applicable: no

â€¢ The company's interest cost has increased due to the RBI's interest rate hike, which has impacted the company's profitability, with the interest cost being 3.7% of revenue.
  - High: no (The increase in interest cost is a significant factor, but without comparing it to the previous year's interest cost as a percentage of revenue, it's hard to classify it as high solely based on the percentage of revenue.)
  - Medium: yes (The increase in interest cost due to the RBI's rate hike and its impact on profitability suggests a medium risk, as it affects the company's bottom line.)
  - Low: no (The impact on profitability due to increased interest cost suggests more than a low risk.)
  - Not_Applicable: no

### Liquidity Issues Risk Classification

â€¢ The company is still facing issues with railway collection, which has not normalized due to delays and project completion issues, with the working capital cycle being 126 days.
  - High: no (The working capital cycle has actually decreased from 148 days to 126 days, indicating an improvement in liquidity.)
  - Medium: no (There is no indication of a medium-level risk based on the provided criteria.)
  - Low: yes (The issue with railway collection is still present, but the working capital cycle has improved, suggesting a low-level risk.)
  - Not_Applicable: no

â€¢ The company has reduced its net working capital by 22 days to 126 days as on 30th June 23, vis-a-vis 148 days as on 30th June 22, and aims to bring it down to 110 days by the end of the year.
  - High: no (The reduction in net working capital days indicates an improvement in liquidity, rather than a high-risk situation.)
  - Medium: no (There is no indication of a medium-level risk based on the provided criteria.)
  - Low: no (The reduction in net working capital days is a positive indicator, but the aim to further reduce it to 110 days suggests a managed risk rather than a low-level risk.)
  - Not_Applicable: no 

However, considering the cash balance and short-term debt criteria:

- The previous reported cash balance was 344 Cr, but the current cash balance is not provided. Therefore, we cannot assess the risk based on the cash balance criteria.
- The previous reported current liabilities were 14,209 Cr, but the current current liabilities are not provided. The debt has increased by INR700 crores, which may indicate an increase in current liabilities, but without the exact numbers, we cannot determine the percentage increase.

Given the information provided and the criteria, we can only assess the risks based on the working capital cycle and the qualitative description of the issues. The main concern is the ongoing issue with railway collection, which affects the company's liquidity, but the reduction in working capital days suggests managed risk.
