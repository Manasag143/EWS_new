- Balance Sheet Issues: Red flags related to the company's assets, liabilities, equity, debt and overall financial position.
- P&L (Income Statement) Issues: Red flags related to the company's revenues, expenses, profits, and overall financial performance.
- Liquidity Issues: Concerns related to the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations, such as cash flow problems, debt repayment issues, or insufficient working capital.
- Management and Strategy related Issues: Concerns related to leadership, governance, decision-making processes, overall strategy, vision, and direction. 
- Regulatory Issues: Concerns related Compliance with laws, regulations. 
- Industry and Market Issues: Concerns related Position within the industry, market trends, and competitive landscape. 
- Operational Issues: Concerns related Internal processes, systems, and infrastructure.

While categorizing the red flags strictly adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Please review the below red flags and assign each one to the most relevant category.
2. Do not loose information from the Original Quotes keep them as it is.
3. If a red flag could fit into multiple categories, please assign it to the one that seems most closely related, do not leave any flag unclassified or fit it into multiple categories.
4. While classifying, classify it in a such a way that the flags come under the categories along with their content. Strictly do not create a new category stick to what is mentioned above like an "Additional Red Flags", classify the flags in the above mentioned category only.
5. Do not repeat a category more than once in the output.

**Output Format**:
### Balance Sheet Issues
- [Red flag 1 from previous analysis with original quote]
