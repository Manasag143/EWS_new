COMPLETE DOCUMENT TO ANALYZE:
{self.docs[0]["context"]}

Your task is to analyze the ENTIRE document above and identify ALL potential red flags. 

CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Number each red flag sequentially (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Start each entry with: "The potential red flag you observed - [brief description]"
- Follow with "Original Quote:" and then the exact quote with speaker names
- Include page references where available: (Page X)
- Ensure comprehensive analysis of the entire document
- Do not miss any sections or concerning statements

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
1. The potential red flag you observed - Debt reduction is lower than expected  
Original Quote:  
"Vikrant Kashyap: Have you -- are you able to reduce any debt in quarter one in Middle East and India?  
Ramesh Kalyanaraman: So India, we are not reduced, but the cash balance has been increased to around INR75 crores, but we have not reduced any debt in Q1 in India and Middle East because Middle East we have not converted any showroom in Q1." (Page 9)  

2. The potential red flag you observed - Margin pressure/Competition intensifying/Cost inflation  
Original Quote:  
"Pulkit Singhal: Thank you for the opportunity and congrats on the good set of performance. Just the first question is really on the margins, which seems to have been elusive. I mean looking at the company for the last two years, we seem to be executing quite well in terms of store expansions and revenue growth and clearly delivering higher than expected there. But margin expansion just has been completely elusive.  
And I find it surprising your comment that while growing at 30% growth and 12% SSSG, I mean, which is quite healthy, you're still talking about high competitive intensity kind of quite contradictory that with such high growth rates, we have to invest so high. So can you talk about this a bit more? I mean we don't expect with lower revenue growth rates that you would not have to invest in the business. And it's only during a higher revenue growth that you expect margin expansion.  
Ramesh Kalyanaraman: Yes. So you're right. We are -- meaning somewhere we have missed out on the operating leverage for advertisements that's why I told you that even Q1, it was a miss. And regarding competition, I will tell you where in new markets, where we assume that we will not spend too much because the brand is already aware and the location is the only thing which has to be communicated.  
When you see the local players, regional players or the micro market players there becoming extremely active because of our showroom launch then we will have to increase the noise level there. Otherwise, we will lose our market share. And existing local players they increase their activity around our launch time. So that is where we also put more money so that we don't end up losing the market share or we don't end up taking out lesser from the competition." (Page 12-13)  

3. The potential red flag you observed - Debt high/Increase in borrowing cost  
Original Quote:  
"Vikrant Kashyap: My question is how are you going to address this? Because if you continue to grow at a higher level, but bottom line is not expanding related to the top line, it will going to impact your overall performance? So, what are the steps you are taking to improve the bottom line in the businesses  
Sanjay Raghuraman: Finance costs will be taken care because we told you when we convert stores, that money is going to reduce our debt. Okay. And again, FOCO, when you do FOCO showrooms, the margins will come down. And surely, that will have an impact on the gross margin. Okay. And interest, if you look at actually, the interest rates have been going up last year. So next year, that will be the base, right? So then again, we will not have this kind of issue is what we feel. So interest rates have been going up over the past year, one year, in that region.  
And we are also beginning to repay loans now because of conversion. So all put together, interest part will be taken care but other area where FOCO showrooms will surely reduce our margin. We cannot have the own store margin. So that should be the way we should look at it." (Page 9)

        third_prompt = """You are an expert in financial analysis tasked at categorizing the below identified red flags related to a company's financial health and operations. You need to categorize the red flags into following categories based on their original quotes and the identified keyword.

- Balance Sheet Issues: Red flags related to the company's assets, liabilities, equity, debt and overall financial position.
- P&L (Income Statement) Issues: Red flags related to the company's revenues, expenses, profits, and overall financial performance.
- Liquidity Issues: Concerns related to the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations, such as cash flow problems, debt repayment issues, or insufficient working capital.
- Management and Strategy related Issues: Concerns related to leadership, governance, decision-making processes, overall strategy, vision, and direction. 
- Regulatory Issues: Concerns related Compliance with laws, regulations. 
- Industry and Market Issues: Concerns related Position within the industry, market trends, and competitive landscape. 
- Operational Issues: Concerns related Internal processes, systems, and infrastructure.

While categorizing the red flags strictly adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Please review the below red flags and assign each one to the most relevant category.
2. Do not loose information from the Original Quotes keep them as it is.
3. If a red flag could fit into multiple categories, please assign it to the one that seems most closely related, do not leave any flag unclassified or fit it into multiple categories.
4. While classifying, classify it in a such a way that the flags come under the categories along with their content. Strictly do not create a new category stick to what is mentioned above like an "Additional Red Flags", classify the flags in the above mentioned category only.
5. Do not repeat a category more than once in the output.

**Output Format**:
### Balance Sheet Issues
- [Red flag 1 from previous analysis with original quote]
- [Red flag 2 from previous analysis with original quote]

### P&L (Income Statement) Issues
- [Red flag 1 from previous analysis with original quote]
- [Red flag 2 from previous analysis with original quote]

### Liquidity Issues
- [Red flag 1 from previous analysis with original quote]
- [Red flag 2 from previous analysis with original quote]

### Management and Strategy related Issues
- [Red flag 1 from previous analysis with original quote]
- [Red flag 2 from previous analysis with original quote]

### Regulatory Issues
- [Red flag 1 from previous analysis with original quote]
- [Red flag 2 from previous analysis with original quote]

### Industry and Market Issues
- [Red flag 1 from previous analysis with original quote]
- [Red flag 2 from previous analysis with original quote]

### Operational Issues
- [Red flag 1 from previous analysis with original quote]
- [Red flag 2 from previous analysis with original quote]

Continue this format for all categories, ensuring every red flag from the previous analysis is categorized properly."""

    1. **Retain all information**: Ensure that no details are omitted or lost during the summarization process
    2. **Maintain a neutral tone**: Present the summary in a factual and objective manner, avoiding any emotional or biased language
    3. **Focus on factual content**: Base the summary solely on the information associated with each red flag, without introducing external opinions or assumptions
    4. **Include all red flags**: Incorporate every red flag within the category into the summary, without exception
    5. **Balance detail and concision**: Provide a summary that is both thorough and concise, avoiding unnecessary elaboration while still conveying all essential information
    6. **Incorporate quantitative data**: Wherever possible, include quantitative data and statistics to support the summary and provide additional context
    7. **Category-specific content**: Ensure that the summary is generated based solely on the content present within each category
    8. **Summary should be factual**: Avoid any subjective interpretations or opinions
    9. **Use bullet points**: Each red flag should be summarized as a separate bullet point with key details and data points

    Format the output exactly like this example:
    ### Balance Sheet Issues
    • [Summary of red flag 1 with specific data points and factual information]
    • [Summary of red flag 2 with specific data points and factual information]
    • [Summary of red flag 3 with specific data points and factual information]
