High-Level Design Principles for GenAI Coding Practices

1. Coding for Deployment

Objective: Production-ready, robust, maintainable, scalable, and secure code intended for long-term use.
•	Code Quality & Standards
o	Follow consistent coding standards and style guides (e.g., PEP8 for Python).
o	Ensure readability and maintainability with clear documentation and comments.
o	Write modular and reusable code components.
o	Use Pydantic models for input request format verification.
•	Testing & Validation
o	Implement comprehensive unit testing.
o	Include performance and load testing where applicable.
•	Performance & Scalability
o	Optimize inference and training pipelines for efficiency.
o	Design for horizontal and vertical scalability.
o	Implement resource management (memory, compute).
•	Security & Compliance
o	Enforce security best practices (e.g., input validation, encryption). Use Vault for storing credentials.
o	Ensure compliance with data privacy laws and organizational policies.
o	Manage access controls and authentication mechanisms strictly.




•	Deployment & Monitoring
o	Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes) for portability.
o	Automate deployment pipelines (CI/CD).
o	Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting for operational visibility.
o	Design rollback and version control strategies.
•	Error Handling & Resilience
o	Incorporate robust error handling and failover mechanisms.
o	Logging in Grafana.
o	Manage edge cases and unexpected inputs.
o	Build retry/logging for transient failures.

2. Coding for Quick Proof of Concept (POC)
 
Objective: Fast, flexible, and exploratory code to validate ideas or concepts quickly with minimal overhead.
•	Development Speed
o	Prioritize rapid development over code perfection or optimization.
o	Use high-level libraries, frameworks, and pre-trained models to accelerate development.
o	Skip extensive modularization if it hinders speed but maintain basic readability.
•	Flexibility & Experimentation
o	Allow easy modifications and experimentation (parameter tuning, feature toggling).
o	Keep code simple and straightforward to quickly test hypotheses.
•	Minimal Documentation
o	Document essential parts only (assumptions, key steps).
o	Use descriptive naming for ease of review without extensive comments.
•	Testing
o	Basic sanity checks against golden truth data instead of full-fledged testing.
o	Ensure outputs are plausible but avoid deep validation at this stage.
•	Resource Management
o	Accept higher resource usage if it shortens development time.
o	Optimize only if bottlenecks significantly hinder experimentation.


•	Disposability
o	Code can be thrown away or heavily refactored later.
o	Focus on learning outcomes rather than long-term maintenance.

3. Summary of design features -
Aspect	Deployment	Quick POC
Primary Goal	Stability, scalability, maintainability	Speed, experimentation,
Code Quality	High, follows standards & style guides	Basic, focused on functionality
Testing	Comprehensive & automated	Sanity checks only
Documentation	Detailed and clear	Minimal and essential
Performance	Optimized and scalable	Acceptable for speed
Security	Strict adherence	Minimal focus
Deployment	Automated CI/CD, containerized	Manual or ad-hoc
Modularity	Highly modular and reusable	Simple, may be monolithic










4. Code Structure Practices.
Follow the attached structure while writing code.


 
Code Practices
Category	Do’s	Don’ts
Code Style	Follow PEP8 for Python	Don’t write absurd imports & functions
	Write re-usable and efficient code, follow KISS and DRY principles	Don’t write same code repeatedly, like API calls and initializations
	Write Class-based / function-based code for re-usability	Don’t’ write general structureless code which needs to be used more than once
		
		
Constants/Credentials	Specify in config.py	Don’t hardcode/declare in code and other files
Comments and Docstrings	Add standard docstrings for every class / function	Don’t write class/function without usage
Naming Conventions	Follow consistent naming for variables, functions and classes. Python – camel case	Don’t write variable names like abc, i, x even in loops.
Data & Debug Logging	Loggers should be implemented everywhere	No prints statements should be used in deployment
Data Model & Validation	Always have input & output validations - use Pydantic
	Don’t write code without data validation
Code Commits	Write meaningful commit messages	Don’t write vague commit messages
Code Review	Every CR must be reviewed by at least one Peer	Don’t push code without raising CR and approval of peer review
CR Checklist	•	Correctness
•	Readability
•	Logging
•	Maintainability
•	Security
•	Error Handling
•	Edge Cases
•	Test Coverage
•	C4 Diagram 
•	README.md	Provide positive feedback
Don’t blame
Metrics	Accuracy:
•	All AI related projects should have accuracy metrics (even in PoCs)
•	Accuracy metrics should be reviewed with AI Leads and Business	Don’t create projects without accuracy metrics, progress isn’t measurable
	System Latency:
•	All AI related projects should have throughput and latency metrics	System latency metrics are crucial for optimization later, don’t miss
Designs & Diagrams	For AI Leads Only:
•	C4 diagrams after PoC signoff prior to development	Don’t encourage projects without flows and diagrams
