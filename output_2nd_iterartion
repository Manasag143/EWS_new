**1. Significant Debt Repayment Challenges, Liquidity Concerns, and Group Company Exposure (Including Related Party Transactions and Demerger-Linked Debt Allocation)**  
Vedanta faces ongoing and material challenges related to high debt levels, complex group company exposures (notably between Vedanta Limited and Vedanta Resources), reliance on internal accruals and dividends for deleveraging, and the need to refinance or restructure significant maturities. The planned demerger further complicates debt allocation, with regulatory requirements mandating debt apportionment based on asset allocation, potentially leading to high debt/EBITDA ratios in some segments. There is also reliance on related party transactions (e.g., ICL) and brand fees to manage group liquidity, and questions remain about the sustainability of these arrangements and the ability of all segments to service their allocated debt post-demerger.

**Original Quotes:**  
- â€œAre we still reiterating that our debt has peaked out in FY'24? And all of the ongoing expansion will be funded through internal accruals as well as the dividend payment which can help in deleveraging parentâ€™s debt?...We will be further deleveraging by 3 billion over three years...both Vedanta Resources and Vedanta Limited will deleverage over the next three years.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 7)  
- â€œCan you please highlight the cash outflow, broad cash outflow either for debt repayment or royalty payment due in the next 3 months and 12 months, both at Vedanta Limited level and on the parent level?...the need for money at Vedanta Resources in the current fiscal is about 1 billion to 1.1 billion...combination of the brand fee and a normalized dividend will be sufficient to meet the obligation at Vedanta Resources about 1-1.1 billion.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 7)  
- â€œSpeaking of Vedanta Limited, at Vedanta standalone, the maturity is about 1.5 billion out of which a very small portion is in the first quarter. Most of the maturity at Vedanta Limited are fully secured. We have secured loans. Hence, refinancing is an option...no new debt need to be raised on the current levels.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 7)  
- â€œJust coming back to the same question on the liability in Vedanta resources the 1.1 is long-term debt. The interest amount is separate over and above this?...almost 0.6 is interest, so 1.1 plus 0.6 about circa 1.7 is the need at Vedanta Resources.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 9)  
- â€œAnd what about the ICL, the 450 million?...almost 417 so between the Vedanta Limited and Vedanta Resources, net it becomes a wash. So if VRL pays which they will as scheduled in December, we get cash flow at Vedanta Limited.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 9)  
- â€œI just wanted to understand that since we are demerging our business, a bulk of our debt is in the stand-alone business, while the stand-alone business current EBITDA probably would not be sufficient enough. So in terms of debt redistribution, can you give us some insight that how this stand-alone debt would be redistributed among the other companies?...all the debt will get allocated across each of the demerged entity in the ratio of the assets in which the asset gets allocated amongst the six different demerge entities...we have apportioned the debt across the six entities. And based on this formula, we have gone to the lenders for the specific approval.â€ (Ajay Agarwal, Page 8)  
- â€œSir, first, a very basic one. You indicated that the debt will be apportioned in the ratio of assets. Sir, why should it be in the ratio of assets? Why not on the basis of cash flow?...it is largely driven under the income tax act given the fact that it will be a tax neutral demerger...Each of these businesses will have strong cash flow as well for it to meet both the asset coverage as well as the interest coverage ratio.â€ (Ajay Agarwal, Page 12)  
- â€œSo if hypothetically it get apportioned on the basis of asset what is the debt-to-EBITDA ratio that one would possibly look at for each of the segments?...we don't believe that the asset cover -- sorry, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be around 5. Most of the lenders are fairly comfortable with the numbers which we have proposed to them. It will be in the range in which we are today. Some businesses maybe have the ability to take on larger debt, for example, power...the residual company, which will be Vedanta standalone which will house FACOR, Nicomet, and Hindustan Zinc may also have a slightly higher debt, but it has the capacity to really service not only the debt, but it will have a larger asset base as well.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 12)  
- â€œSee, when we see the need of the money at VRL - it is about $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion, including interest in the current year FY '25...combination of the brand fees, the routine dividend will be sufficient to meet target of $3 billion deleveraging over 3 years and at Vedanta Resources.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 13)  
- â€œNo. Sir, actually my questions pertain to that there was a lot in the media circle that we wanted to sell part of the stake in the mine. So the three-year plan of 3 billion debt repayment in Vedanta Resources cumulatively, does that number include your internal calculation on stake sale also or that is over and above?...That 3 billion is purely organic cash flows. From the operating cash flows, we will be deleveraging the VRL and the group over the next three years' time. Any actions strategically will be incremental over these numbers.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 9)

**2. Delays and Regulatory Uncertainty Affecting Strategic Initiatives, Asset Sales, Demerger, and Key Project Approvals**  
Multiple strategic initiativesâ€”including the sale of the steel plant, the vertical split/demerger, and the commissioning of key coal minesâ€”are facing delays due to pending regulatory clearances, lender NOCs, and environmental/forest approvals. These delays create uncertainty around the timing and realization of planned transactions and growth projects, with potential knock-on effects for financial planning and operational execution.

**Original Quotes:**  
- â€œLet me address the strategic sale of our steel plant asset. Yes, it is still under consideration. And of course, there are certain regulatory clearances which are yet pending, and we are very hopeful...that in this quarter- first quarter of this fiscal itself, all the regulatory clearances will be over. So then perhaps, the transaction if it were to happen, it could happen at that time.â€ (Arun Misra, Page 6)  
- â€œSo on the demerger part...all the questions which were raised by both NSE and BSE has been appropriately resolved. The only thing which is pending now is to get the NOC from the lenders for us to file the application with the NCLT...we have started to receive few of the NOCs from the private lenders. And from the PSUs, the discussions are on, and we are very confident to get a few of the NOCs by the end of this month, and the rest will also follow start of the next month.â€ (Ajay Agarwal, Page 6)  
- â€œOn the issue of coal mines for our aluminum sector, Jamkhani coal mines produced 2.1 million tons in last year and is slated to produce more than 2.6 million tons in the coming fiscal year. Radhikapur coal block, it is likely to start in quarter four of the current fiscal year. Its environment clearance is in place. Forest clearance, Stage 1 has been obtained. Now the compliances of Stage 1 is being done. After that the Stage 2 clearance will be obtained. On the Kuraloi mine, environment clearance is recommended, forest clearance Stage 1 is in progress, likely commissioning again in quarter four of financial year '25, that's current fiscal year. And Ghogharpalli, allocation has been done. It's likely to come into line in financial year '26, that's next fiscal year.â€ (Arun Misra, Page 7)  
- â€œSo you should see if we get the environment clearance in quarter 1, so then it will take some 3 to 4 months' time for transaction and all that, maybe in quarter 1 end or quarter 2 sometime in the middle.â€ (Arun Misra, Page 11)  
- â€œGot it. And just last question, sorry, on the transfer of the general reserves to the retained earnings at the Vedanta level. Is there any movement there on the lenders approval?...It is where it was last time and nothing significant I must point out. So nothing much on the Vedanta side. But there is progress in terms of zinc discussion and as you know we are done through all steps including approval shareholders. The second motion is also filed with NCLT. The hearing was done on 18th of April. It has been postponed to 17th of May and we hope this will get finished in the current quarter.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 10)

**3. Margin Pressure and Low Profitability in Steel Business**  
The steel business (ESL) continues to face margin pressure and low profitability, primarily due to poor net sales realization (NSR) for pig iron and high coking coal prices. While cost management efforts are ongoing and expansion into value-added products is expected to help, the business remains structurally challenged versus industry peers.

**Original Quotes:**  
- â€œAnd lastly, on the steel business we are running at good utilization around 1.3 million, 1.4 million tons volume when the margins have been quite poor. So I mean, is there an issue with the - I mean, what are the key reasons our margins have been quite inferior versus the industry. So if you could just explain on that? . So on the cost side, although has been managed, the cost has come down, but our pig iron which is a substantial portion of the output did not face good NSR in the market. And that has squeezed the margin. However, that's why our DI plant expansion project that should get commissioned this time will add more value-added products and is likely to improve the margins going forward.â€ (Arun Misra, Page 11)  
- â€œAnd also just on the steel business. So I think ESL has a captive iron ore mine. So I'm guessing the recent -- I mean, the EBITDA loss was probably because of coking coal prices. So coking coal prices coming down, can this turn back into a positive EBITDA in the coming quarters? Yes. Obviously, the coking coal prices start coming down and at the same time, the DI plant pipe plants get commissioned, so they're adding more MSR to the margins to the products then of course, it will turn profitable. There is no reason why it should not.â€ (Arun Misra, Page 14)

**4. Operational Underperformance and Production Shortfalls in Zinc International**  
Zinc International has been underperforming relative to production and cost guidance, primarily due to delays in overburden removal and ore production, resulting in missed targets and lower output.

**Original Quote:**  
â€œOkay. So currently, there was a timing gap in overburden removal and ore production. And so they missed targets for overburden removal for last few quarters, which has resulted in lack of production from their front. Currently, they will continue at the current rate of about 33, 30 to 35 KT MIC in a quarter from first quarter, ending the year at about 65-70 KT-- 65 KT MIC. So this year, as we see, they're likely to produce between 160 to 180 KT of MIC.â€ (Arun Misra, Page 15)

**5. Declining Production and Margin Pressure in Oil & Gas Segment**  
The oil and gas business is experiencing declining production and lower realizations, though cost management has partially offset the impact. There is a risk that natural decline may continue to pressure volumes and margins, despite ongoing operational efforts.

**Original Quotes:**  
- â€œSecond question pertains to our oil and gas business, while the realizations and volumes are lower, operating performance had been pretty good. So am I missing something because sequential also, there was a significant improvement. No. What has been achieved is in spite of decline in production, the cost management has been very good. So the target of keeping the cost between $14 to $15 per barrel has been achieved. Further, Steve, anything you'd like to add?â€ (Arun Misra, Page 8)  
- â€œThe second question is on Oil & Gas division. So while in oil and gas, despite our efforts at helpline of polymer injection and all, we have seen that the natural decline has somehow caused production to go down. And our current guidance that we have given 120 to 140 KBOEPD for this year against 118 what we have achieved. How do we intend to increase the production? Whether it will be closer to 130 or what would be the key enablers for it to reach 140?â€ (Amit Dixit, Page 16)

**6. Impairment Charges and One-Off Write-Offs on Copper Smelter Asset**  
Vedanta has taken a significant impairment charge on its copper smelter asset, writing off a portion of the carrying value due to adverse regulatory rulings. While management asserts no further downside is expected, the impairment highlights asset risk and the impact of regulatory actions.

**Original Quote:**  
â€œYes. Good evening, sir. So I have a question on the copper smelter impairment that we have taken. So have we only written off part of the total value so the carrying value I think as per notes to accounts was something like INR1,681 crores. But we've impaired only about INR746 crores. So is the balance â€“ other balance assets like can they be sold? Or can they use somewhere else?...from impairment viewpoint Tuticorin there'll be no further downside in future irrespective of what the outcome is of that asset.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 14)

**7. Working Capital Reductionâ€”Potential Risk if Unsustainable**  
Vedanta has achieved a sharp reduction in working capital days, primarily through lower receivables and inventory. While management claims this is structural, there is a risk that such reductions may not be sustainable, especially if driven by one-off inventory sales or changes in credit terms.

**Original Quote:**  
â€œOne of the focus areas Kunal in the last 6-odd quarters have been in terms of managing the working capital. And we've done multiple changes, structurally so. If you see the fourth quarter alone, the number of working capital days has come down by almost, to 77 days which is for Vedanta historical best over last all the years...our working capital is lower by more than 1 billion. So it is structural, and that will continue.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 15)

**8. Cost Inflation and Operational Issues in Aluminum Segment**  
Despite lower e-auction coal prices, aluminum segment power costs increased due to major maintenance events and the need to purchase higher-cost third-party power. This raises concerns about cost volatility and operational resilience.

**Original Quote:**  
â€œIn cost of production, power costs have gone up despite e-auction prices going down significantly in the quarter. So just wanted to understand whether it is the inventory effect and if so, then the coal cost should go down significantly actually in Q1 FY '25. Is it the correct assessment?...in the quarter, we had two major overhaul events, which means that we are incurring higher costs for the maintenance events. And at the same time, we need to purchase power from third-party sources to supplement that. And that's higher than our internal generation costs. So those are the two big drivers for the increase quarter-over-quarter. In terms of our coal cost, the coal cost has continued to be around the same level quarter-over-quarter.â€ (John Slaven, Page 16)

**9. Regulatory and Market Risk Impacting Commodity Prices**  
Recent regulatory actions (e.g., US/UK ban on Russian metal imports) have created short-term volatility and uncertainty in commodity prices, particularly for aluminum and zinc. The long-term sustainability of current price levels is unclear, and market participants are still assessing the impact.

**Original Quote:**  
â€œWhat we are seeing in the current months and probably over the next couple of months is an impact of decisions taken by the U.S. and the U.K. to ban import of Russian metal -- this is having an impact on the LME, the LME has imposed certain limitations on storing Russian metal in the LME warehouses and what metal can be taken out...I'm not sure whether we're going to maintain the current levels -- and as Ajay mentioned, we are doing some initial hedging, but very small quantities because we do see contango in the market. We are expecting, as other market participants there are some continued strength in the market over the medium term.â€ (John Slaven, Page 17)

**10. Delays in Power Project Commissioning**  
Commissioning of key power projects (Meenakshi and Athena) is ongoing, with timelines extending into the next financial year. Delays in these projects could impact planned capacity additions and financial returns.

**Original Quote:**  
â€œSo Meenakshi 150-megawatt is about to be commissioned. We are on that process. And on Athena, financing and all being taken care of, and it should also come in line sometime in the next financial year.â€ (Arun Misra, Page 18)

**11. Operational Challenges in International Mining Assets**  
International mining assets, particularly in South Africa, are facing operational challenges such as overburden stripping, which may impact production and growth plans.

**Original Quote:**  
â€œNo. So we are very focused on growing all our assets primarily in domestic market in India at the center of our international assets, if you look at, which is in South Africa, where our 30 million ton reserve that we have we need to grow that business. Currently, it is getting some challenges on overburden stripping but we'll continue that effort.â€ (Arun Misra, Page 18)  

---

**12. Hedging and Market Risk Management**  
Vedanta has resumed commodity hedging in response to price volatility, but only for a small portion of volumes. The company acknowledges ongoing market risk and the need for continuous risk management.

**Original Quote:**  
â€œVery much Ritesh in fact, risk management on the pricing is a continuous process -- and you're right, we hedged a couple of years ago. And it proved to be a good measure. We gained more than 0.5 billion on the hedging part. Recently, we have begun to hedge knowing the pricing is moving upward. We made a small beginning almost 120 KT almost a 5% volume for Aluminum has been hedged...Now I also like to point out, if you look at the forward curve for most pricing, it is showing all contango, which means everybody believes the pricing of all commodities will keep going northwards and hence, hedge, not to hedge will be a continuous process.â€ (Ajay Goel, Page 13)
